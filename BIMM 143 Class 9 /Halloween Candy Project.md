> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale
> to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

Variable winpercent, it is on 0-100 scale while other variables are all
between 0-1.

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the
> candy\$chocolate column?

Zero for candy\$chocolate column means the candy does not contain
chocolate, while one means the candy contain chocolate.

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

``` r
library(ggplot2)
```

``` r
ggplot(candy,
       aes(x = candy$winpercent)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

    Warning: Use of `candy$winpercent` is discouraged.
    ℹ Use `winpercent` instead.

    `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

Not symmetrical, the distribution is skewed to the right.

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

The center of the distribution is below 50%

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit
> candy?

``` r
choc_candy <- candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)]
fruit_candy <- candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)]

mean_winpercent_chocolate <- mean(choc_candy)
mean_winpercent_fruity <- mean(fruit_candy)

mean_winpercent_chocolate
```

``` r
mean_winpercent_fruity
```

    [1] 44.11974

``` r
mean_winpercent_chocolate > mean_winpercent_fruity
```

    [1] TRUE

On average chololate containing candy is higher ranked than fruity
candy.

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

``` r
t.test(choc_candy, fruit_candy)
```

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

``` r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy,
       aes(x = winpercent, y = rownames(candy))) + 
      geom_col() + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 3))
```

![](Halloween-Candy-Project_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars
> sorted by winpercent?

``` r
ggplot(candy,
       aes(x = winpercent, y = reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent))) + 
      geom_col() + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 3))
```

![](Halloween-Candy-Project_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)

Let’s setup a color vector (that signifies candy type) that we can then
use for some future plots. We start by making a vector of all black
values (one for each candy). Then we overwrite chocolate (for chocolate
candy), brown (for candy bars) and red (for fruity candy) values.

``` r
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

Now let’s try our barplot with these colors. Note that we use
fill=my_cols for `geom_col()`. Experiment to see what happens if you use
col=mycols.

``` r
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 3))
```

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

### 4. Taking a look at pricepercent

``` r
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 100)
```

> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for
> the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reese’s Miniatures

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and
> of these which is the least popular?

``` r
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head(candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5)
```

                             pricepercent winpercent
    Nik L Nip                       0.976   22.44534
    Nestle Smarties                 0.976   37.88719
    Ring pop                        0.965   35.29076
    Hershey's Krackel               0.918   62.28448
    Hershey's Milk Chocolate        0.918   56.49050

The least popular from the most expensive is Nik L Nip.

Optional Q21. Make a barplot again with `geom_col()` this time using
pricepercent and then improve this step by step, first ordering the
x-axis by value and finally making a so called “dot chat” or “lollipop”
chart by swapping `geom_col()` for `geom_point()` + `geom_segment()`.

``` r
# Make a lollipop chart of pricepercent
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(pricepercent, reorder(rownames(candy), pricepercent)) +
  geom_segment(aes(yend = reorder(rownames(candy), pricepercent), 
                   xend = 0), col="gray40") +
    geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 3))
```

### 5. Exploring the correlation structure

``` r
library(corrplot)
```

    corrplot 0.95 loaded

``` r
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

![](Halloween-Candy-Project_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png)

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated
> (i.e. have minus values)?

Variables fruity and chocolate are strongly anti-correlated. Variables
pluribus and bar are the next most anti-correlated. There are others
also have minus values, but are not strongly correlated.

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Variables winpercent and chocolate, and bar and chocolate are most
positively correlated.

### 6. Principal Component Analysis

Interactive plot to see the labels:

#ggplotly(p)
```

Let’s finish by taking a quick look at PCA our loadings. Do these make
sense to you? Notice the opposite effects of chocolate and fruity and
the similar effects of chocolate and bar (i.e. we already know they are
correlated).

``` r
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```

![](Halloween-Candy-Project_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png)

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the
> positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Variables chocolate, fruity, and bar are picked up strongly by PC1. This
plot is consistent with the correlation, as chocolate and bar are
strongly positively correlated and chocolate and fruity are strongly
negatively correlated.
